title: Welcome to CurrentX
---

CurrentX is a MegaETH DEX with Uniswap V3 style swaps and a dual liquidity system: V2 pools and V3 concentrated positions. These docs cover the current UI flows and the exact on-chain and build-time parameters used by the app.

## What you'll find

- User flows for Dashboard, Swap (V3), Liquidity (V2 + V3 positions), and Farms.
- Developer references for network config, contract addresses, tokens, and ABIs.
- Migration notes whenever contracts, addresses, or flows change.

## Network scope

- Mainnet only (MegaETH `chainId 0x10e6`, decimal `4326`).
