Whitelist rewards are **not additional supply**. They are funded from existing allocations (typically **Treasury / Runway** or **Leaderboard Rewards**).
:::

:::note Budget (cap)
- **Whitelist budget cap:** **1% of supply = 10,000 CRX**
:::

### Per-wallet rewards
- **Base reward:** **20–50 CRX** for being whitelisted (claimable)
- **Activation bonus:** **50–150 CRX** only if, within **X days**, the wallet completes:
  - **1 swap** (any size) **AND**
  - either **$50–$200 cumulative volume** OR **a micro LP** on **CRX/ETH** or **CRX/USDM**

### Payment schedule
- **30%** claimable immediately
- **70%** streamed/vested over **30–60 days**

---

## Points System

### Base Points
- **1 USD traded = 1 point**

### Multipliers
- **Swap:** 1×
- **Add Liquidity:** 2× or 3× (pool-dependent)

:::tip Boosted pools
Multipliers/boosts apply only on:
- **CRX/ETH**
- **CRX/USDM**
:::

---

## Rewards Distribution Formula

At the end of each season:

`CRX_user = CRX_season × (points_user / total_points_season)`

Where:
- `CRX_user` = user rewards for the season
- `CRX_season` = total CRX allocated for the season
- `points_user` = user points earned during the season
- `total_points_season` = total points earned by all participants during the season

---

## Claim

Rewards are claimable at the end of each season, once finalization is complete.

## Partnerships / MM / Aggregator Grants (Milestone-Based)

:::tip Milestone-based releases
Partnership grants are released by milestones to ensure alignment and sustained flow.
:::

| Step | % of Grant | Condition |
|---|---:|---|
| Step 1 | 30% | Integration live (routing / MM active) |
| Step 2 | 40% | Flow KPI met (e.g., X days sustained volume) |
| Step 3 | 30% | Retention for 30–60 days + quality flow |
