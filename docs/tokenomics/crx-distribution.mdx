# CRX Distribution & Leaderboard Rewards

This page is the canonical CRX distribution policy and must stay aligned with `/docs/tokenomics`.

:::note Supply
**Total supply:** **1,000,000 CRX**
CRX is fixed supply. Leaderboard rewards are distributed from existing allocations, with no additional minting.
:::

## Distribution Overview (Official)

| Leaderboard Rewards (Seasons) | 40% | 400,000 | Seasonal rewards for swap and LP activity. |
| Farms / Liquidity Mining | 15% | 150,000 | Incentives for LP and position programs. |

## Leaderboard Rewards Schedule

:::note Rewards allocation
Total rewards allocated to leaderboard seasons: **400,000 CRX**
:::

| Season | CRX Allocation | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Season 1 | 120,000 | Early bootstrapping |
| Season 2 | 90,000 | Maintain momentum |
| Season 3 | 70,000 | Reduced emissions |
| Season 4 | 50,000 | Consolidation |
| Season 5 | 40,000 | Sustain |
| Season 6 | 30,000 | Sustain / transition |
| **Total** | **400,000** |  |

Each season allocation follows the same payout mechanics: `30%` unlocks at claim and `70%` vests linearly over `90 days` from claim time, so the full season amount is not instantly liquid.

## Season Timing

:::note Season 1 schedule
- **Season 1 starts:** **2026-02-12 00:00 UTC (00:00 UK/GMT, 01:00 Rome/CET)**
- **Season 1 ends:** **2026-03-12 00:00 UTC (00:00 UK/GMT, 01:00 Rome/CET)**
- **Finalization target:** **2026-03-14 00:00 UTC (00:00 UK/GMT, 01:00 Rome/CET)**
- **Claim opens:** **2026-03-14 00:00 UTC (00:00 UK/GMT, 01:00 Rome/CET)** after finalization completes
:::

## Whitelist Rewards (Activation Model)

:::caution Important
Whitelist rewards are **not additional supply**. They are funded from existing allocations (typically **Treasury / Runway** or **Leaderboard Rewards**).
:::

:::note Budget cap
- **Whitelist budget cap:** **1% of supply = 10,000 CRX**
:::

### Per-wallet rewards

- **Base reward:** **20-50 CRX** for being whitelisted.
- **Activation bonus:** **50-150 CRX** only if, within **X days**, the wallet completes:
  - **1 swap** (any size), and
  - either **$50-$200 cumulative volume** or **a micro LP** on **CRX/ETH** or **CRX/USDM**.

### Payment schedule

- **30%** claimable immediately.
- **70%** streamed or vested over **30-60 days**.

## Points System

### Base points

- **1 USD traded = 1 point**

### Multipliers

- **Swap:** `1x`
- **Add liquidity:** `2x` or `3x` (pool-dependent)

:::tip Boosted pools
Multipliers and boosts apply only on:
- **CRX/ETH**
- **CRX/USDM**
:::

## Rewards Distribution Formula

At the end of each season:

`CRX_user = CRX_season * (points_user / total_points_season)`

Where:
- `CRX_user` = user rewards for the season
- `CRX_season` = total CRX allocated for the season
- `points_user` = user points earned during the season
- `total_points_season` = total points earned by all participants during the season

## Claim

Leaderboard season rewards follow this claim flow:

- Season length: leaderboard seasons run on a `30-day` cadence (Season 1 uses the fixed dates listed above).
- Eligibility: rewards become claimable only after season finalization is complete.
- Immediate unlock: `30%` of the user reward unlocks at claim.
- Vesting: the remaining `70%` vests linearly over `90 days`.
- Vesting start: the `90-day` vesting period starts when the user claims. Delaying claim delays vesting start.
- Supply source: rewards are funded from existing CRX allocations; no additional CRX is minted.

## Partnerships / MM / Aggregator Grants (Milestone-based)

| Step 3 | 30% | Retention for 30-60 days + quality flow |
