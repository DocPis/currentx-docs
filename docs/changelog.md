## 2026-02-12

- Aligned docs to the current `currentx-dex` runtime on MegaETH (`0x10e6` / `4326`).
- Unified swap docs around smart V3 + V2 routing, Universal Router execution, and Permit2 approvals.
- Updated `overview`, `intro`, `swap`, `architecture`, `migration-guide`, and `status` to remove stale routing/network contradictions.
- Updated contracts/network references to current addresses from `src/shared/config/networks.js`.
- Kept one canonical tokenomics allocation and removed non-active legacy allocation content.
- Standardized Season 1 timestamps in UTC + UK/GMT + Rome/CET format.

## 2026-02-04

- Migration notes introduced Universal Router + Permit2 + V3 quoting direction.
- This entry remains historical; canonical live behavior is documented by the `2026-02-12` baseline.
