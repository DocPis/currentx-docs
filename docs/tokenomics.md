## Recommended Split

Total supply: 1,000,000 CRX.

| Bucket | CRX | % | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initial POL (protocol-owned liquidity) | 250,000 | 25% | Set for launch. |
| Incentives (V3 stakers / liquidity bootstrap) | 250,000 | 25% | Emissions runway to grow pools. |
| Team + core treasury | 250,000 | 25% | Operations and future runway, vested for credibility. |
| Partnerships / market-making / integrations | 150,000 | 15% | Real partner deals and liquidity programs. |
| Airdrop + points leaderboard | 100,000 | 10% | Growth without immediate dumping. |

## Why This Split Works Day One (MegaETH)

- 25% incentives provides enough runway to grow pools without burning half the supply.
- 15% partnerships gives real ammunition for market-making, aggregators, bridges, listings, and joint campaigns.
- 10% points or airdrop drives growth while avoiding a large one-time dump if claims are structured.
- 25% team and treasury covers operations, emergencies, and future work, with vesting to signal seriousness.

## Key Rules to Prevent Farming or Dumps

### Airdrop + Points (100,000 CRX)

- Avoid 100% immediate claims. Example: 30% immediate claim, 70% vesting over 60 to 90 days.
- Convert points to CRX with a per-wallet cap and anti-sybil checks (minimum volume, minimum active days, and similar filters).
- Run the leaderboard in seasons (2 to 4 weeks) instead of continuous emissions.

### Partnerships / Market-Making / Integrations (150,000 CRX)

- Use milestones. Example: 25% upfront and the remainder released only after objectives are met (integration live, minimum volume, campaigns completed).
- For market-making, stream rewards daily or weekly rather than paying a lump sum.

### Incentives (250,000 CRX)

- Use 7 to 14 day epochs with a fixed budget and a kill switch.
- Pay rewards only on useful liquidity ranges near the price so incentives do not buy cosmetic TVL.

### Team + Treasury (250,000 CRX)

- Use a 3 to 6 month cliff and 24 to 36 month vesting, even for treasury allocations.
- Hold treasury in a multisig.
