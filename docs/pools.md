## Pool List

The Pools view lists active V2 pools and supports filtering by token pair and TVL.

## Metrics

Common metrics shown per pool:
- TVL.
- 24h volume.
- 24h fees.
- APR (fee APR and, when available, incentive APR).

## APR Breakdown

- Fee APR is estimated from recent fee activity relative to TVL.
- Incentive APR is estimated from farm emissions for pools mapped in MasterChef.

APR values are estimates and can change quickly with market activity.

## V3 Listing Status

V3 pool rows are not currently live in the app UI.
